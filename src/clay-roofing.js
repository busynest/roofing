        <strong>Fiber Cement:</strong> Fiber-cement composite tile is composed of concrete, clay, and wood fiber. This mixture is both durable and fireproof and often shaped to look like shakes. Fiber-cement tiles are not as heavy as regular concrete
        tiles so they don't need extra-heavy roof structures. Fiber cement is available in a variety of textures and colors and is very durable â€” as long as you don't step on them or live in very cold climates because they can crack. Green Factor: Can
        be recycled, are non-leaching and make a good base for water collection.
